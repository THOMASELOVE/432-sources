Sources of Reading Material for PQHS/CRSP 432 with Dr. Love

This is a repository of things I may use or refer to during the semester. If you're looking for additional things to read, this is the right place. 

Some items are **password-protected**, which if you click them will only let you download them from Github, and then open with a password on your own machine. The password is revealed in the first class session.

All of these items will be linked through [Class READMEs](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-classes-2025), as well, as they become useful to us.

## YouTube Video Series Recommended by Dr. Love

1. Frank Harrell's [Biostatistics for Biomedical Research (BBR) Course](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-o_ZZ0tuFUYn8e8rf-QURA/videos) includes a series of lectures on many of the topics we'll be discussing in 432, in addition to several late-breaking items. Details on the course are available [here](https://hbiostat.org/bbr/) and the notes are linked in the Statistics and Modeling books below.
2. Richard McElreath [Statistical Rethinking (Winter 2023)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdnMWdICdRs&list=PLDcUM9US4XdPz-KxHM4XHt7uUVGWWVSus) lecture series is the best introduction to Bayesian ideas and methods available. 
    - Read more about the course at https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2023.
    - If you want to just spend two hours rather than dive in to the full thing, Richard's lecture [Bayesian Inference is Just Counting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NEMHM1wDfI) is great, too.
    - Richard's book [Statistical Rethinking (2nd edition)](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) is available to you through [the CWRU library system](https://case.edu/library/) as an ebook. See also the freely available book by Kurz, below.

## Learning about Quarto (and making the switch from R Markdown)

1. Virtually any code you have written in R Markdown can be run using Quarto instead, by simply switching the file extension from .Rmd to .qmd.
2. It's still worth it to learn about how Quarto works, and why it differs from R Markdown when it does.

Here are some suggestions:

- <https://quarto.org/> is the main website for all things Quarto, will help you get started making the transition, and has a detailed set of guides and references.
    - Here's the start of the [Tutorial, including Hello, Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html) that shows you how to use Quarto with RStudio, which is what you'll be doing in this class.
    - This [FAQ for R Markdown users](https://quarto.org/docs/faq/rmarkdown.html) might be a good starting point.
    - Alison Hill wrote a great blog post [We don't talk about Quarto](https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2022-04-we-dont-talk-about-quarto/) which got me started last April.
- [R for Data Science (2nd edition)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) has three chapters on [Communication](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/communicate.html) which include sections dedicated to Quarto, Quarto formats and a Quarto workflow.
- YouTube videos discussing Quarto that may be of interest to you include (in no special order):

Maybe they'll help you.

    - "A discussion of events that transpired in the past year, where a group of surgical researchers decided to ignore much of the statistical literature and promote a highly misleading practice of calculating post-hoc power using the observed effect size."
    - Some related pieces at LessLikely include "[Misplaced Confidence in Observed Power](https://lesslikely.com/statistics/misplaced-power/)" and "[P-Values Are Tough and S-Values Can Help](https://lesslikely.com/statistics/s-values/)".
- Andrew Gelman: [Statistical-significance thinking is not just a bad way to publish, it’s also a bad way to think](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2019/03/16/statistical-significance-thinking-is-not-just-a-bad-way-to-publish-its-also-a-bad-way-to-think/) - the money quote: "it’s ultimately not about what it takes, or should take, to get a result published, but rather how we as researchers can navigate through uncertainty and not get faked out by noise in our own data."
